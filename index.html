        <p>Last night,after I read an article about Law. The following are my thoughts about it.<br>Law sometimes has a confusion,just like there is the color  gray between black and white in the color spectrum. When we use the two words right and wrong to describe the constitution ,we will bring some small prejudice and misleading. Meanwhile,code is the result of game theories and struggles. Just because such system of rules are not so simple and obvious. Most of the time, they are not a set of definite standard answers.<br>For instance ,one of the top trending topics—“996”.Thousands of workers desperately work hard without the overtime pay. The label law,capitalists and workers are the different sides of the dispute. The process in which the laboring people fight for their own rights has run through the history of the whole capitalist society.</p>

        <p> During this Spring festival,a great number of films are on show. Whilst, I notice a unsightly behavior which makes some people uncomfortable——using phones to take a picture of the film screen.<br>I think this demeanor at least is a kind of infringement. It first violates the right of other audiences to watch the film without interference. Why should we be disturbed by this unethical behavior when we all spend the same money to have fun watching movies.<br>At the same time,it infringes the copyright of the movie. I think this kind of screen photography is usually published on social media, otherwise it will be meaningless for people who take pictures on the screen. It means that he is using an abnormal way to reproduce part of the content of a work, and its quality is definitely greatly reduced. For creators or publishers, their works are distorted to a certain extent. This is a loss to the original author. In view of the fact that copyright should be a right initiated only by the infringed party, screen photography may be the lightest of many infringements (screen photography is not really different from stealing photography), and copyright owners may not be investigated, but those who do such acts should not legitimize screen photography in the name of “sharing” or “helping propaganda”.<br>I also searched the Internet,in Hong Kong,there is a fine of about 50000 RMB and imprisonment for 3 months. I am looking forward that Chinese government will make stricter laws like this in the future.</p>

        <p> I am Lillian who is a 15-year-old girl from Nanjing. Many people think that I am very gentle, careful and imaginative . At home ,with the status of a daughter,a granddaughter and a sister,I am very helpful and attentive to my siblings and parents,for example ,I wash dishes twice a week after dinner.<br> My friends consider me as a girl who enjoys life to the full, I like dancing, singing and watching art exhibitions in my free time. As a result, we usually participate in art festivals together. Last week ，we danced Forever Young together in the stage during the Christmas Gala. Also, there seems to be a consensus that I enjoy trying new things which make me come out of my own comfort zone. For instance , this term, I participated in the Students’ Union and was successful to be a member in the union.<br> In most team work activities, my classmates choose me to be the leader from time to time,due to the fact that I am not only be a risk taker with excellent leadership and communication skills,but also a coordinator who can bring harmony to groups and delegate well and fairly.<br> So far，one of my proudest achievements is persisting in playing the piano for more than eight years. When I started learning that, I was in kindergarten. There are several reasons why I take pride in it. Firstly, just as the saying goes “Practice makes perfect.”. I spend over an hour playing it every day and it has become part of my daily routine. Secondly, I have become a music fan during this process. I particularly enjoy R&amp;B music，classical style and pop music.<br> At weekends，I go to live house as soon as I am free because it can make me relax after a busy day. In addition, I am learning the Ukulele to satisfy my deep musical interest. In general,The piano has become like a best friend to me and will forever be part of me and music has taught me so much such as being patient, focused and creative. It also allows me to lose myself in a different world.</p>

        <p>This week，to celebrate the coming of the new year 2021, our school held a Food Festival. Our class sold coffee,milk teas,Pot Chicken,Wnton and chips. It was such a happy but hard experience. Actually,we did not get high profits in the end of the day. Instead,I understood some facts. I learned that making money is very very difficult. So we should not waste it. Keeping studying now is the only way to realize it some day.</p>
<p>Good night，girl！Tomorrow is a another day.</p>

        <p> As a member of General Technology Publicity Department in the Student Union，this week，we arranged the blackboard newspaper in our activity classroom.</p>
<p>  In the first period，we collected a large amount of posters from three grades. These posters were  about different subjects like Economics,Chemistry and so on. Then,we classified the posters by colors. In fact ,some tabloids were just monochrome and concise. If we put this kind all together, the background might look ugly. After a short discussion with other members and presidents of the union,we decided to put less colorful posters in the corners in order,then decorating the main parts with magnificent posters instead.</p>
<p> By one-hour hard work,all the posters were put up on the blackboard. However, there were still many open spaces in the blackboard. So we planned to decorate it with some colorful papers,stickers and cute pictures. Moreover，I went to teacher’s office to lend two boxes of drawing pins to fix these ornaments. The best part was that we drew some pictures with crayons by ourselves，for instance，red loving hearts，small cats，crash. We all had a good time in the process.</p>
<p>  Every time I saw the beautiful blackboard newspaper , I felt proud of myself very much. From this experience，I learned the importance of the cooperation and we should balance our different ideas to achieve the best result. Hence,we may be more efficient.</p>

        <p> Yesterday in the economic lessons,I leaned about the knowledge of “Labor Market” which is closely related to our real life.</p>
<p>  There are many people finding works,but the occupations are scarce. As a result,there are also a wide range of factors that may influence a person’s choice of occupations including wage factors,non-wage factors and other limiting factors.</p>
<p>  Wage factors,of course,is the most important element. Generally speaking,the higher the salaries on offer,the more a person would want to do the job. Wage rate means the basic wage a worker receives per unit. I think if I need to find a job,I may think of it first. Due to the life quantity depends on incomes a lot. A high bonuses or commission may attract someone too,but not every job has extra bonuses.</p>
<p>  Moreover,some other non-wage factors may be attached importance to by people. I will list a few the most principal reasons. First,some jobs can provide a high degree of job satisfaction,which would result in a higher degree of motivation. For example,most teachers have happiness during their whole teaching career. Not only the success of their students in study,but also receiving thanks from parents. That is the pride of all their lifetime. Second,the length of holidays makes a big difference. Although the government have made laws to set down a minimum length for full-time workers. In Western countries,some companies may provide more holidays for delivery mothers,newly married couples and so on.</p>
<p>   From this lesson,I learned that everyone have their different choices for a job. All in all,the most suitable one is the best!</p>

        <p>This week,my group finished the most excellent presentation by joint efforts in ESL lessons. There are other five group members which are Judy, Amy, Jar, Victory and Bill. In such a short time,we should do a survey about transportation ,process and analyze data ,draw graphs ,make a ppt and so on.</p>
<p>At weekends,we did a survey both online and offline. About 69 students and teachers finished our surveys with 20 questions. These questions were carefully designed by us,including :How old are you?How long does it take to take to get to school?</p>
<p>​     What kind of transport do you usually use?</p>
<p>​     What do you think of this transport?</p>
<p>​     What problems do you meet when going outside?</p>
<p>​     Do you like cars used electricity or petrol?</p>
<p>​      ……</p>
<p>Then we started to make a large number of histograms and pie charts. My main job was  the most difficult. I needed to draw conclusions in the end. By comparing different figures and summarizing the similar facts,I found that factors like time,safety,age all influenced each other.</p>
<p> Also, I learned many general presentation language. At first,we should give a greeting ,welcome and introduce ourselves. Then,we need to give the topic and aims. In addition,content is necessary too. Between sections,handing over to a teammate was needed to men. Finally,as the reporters,we were willing to answer anyone’s questions. </p>
<p> I was proud of every member of my team. What a pleasant cooperation!</p>

        <p>This week，I put in a great deal of effort on preparing for the Mock Trial Competition and finished the preliminary contest successfully with my friends .</p>
<p>There are four parts which are Opening Statements, Direct Examination, Cross Examination and Closing Statements.</p>
<p>I was the lawyer,so my most important mission is to protect my witness and prove our responsibility is smaller than the other side.</p>
<p> At first,I read large amount of materials to know about every character .I helped my witness to think of the both questions and answers to write manuscript of direct examination .At the same time,I must write the questions to ask the opposite .It is really hard experiences.I was asked to rewrite again and again by the senior older schoolmate.</p>
<p> Then,I had a short talk with the lawyers in the con side .We introduced some information about our own witness to each other .It can save lots of time .But in the real competition,this behavior would not be allowed.</p>
<p>Finally,I also wrote the closing argument which is a big work. In the last days,I should memorize my words as more as possible.</p>
<p>In general ,participating in mock trial competition is not only good to the cultivation of students’ legal consciousness, social awareness, civic awareness and team cooperation awareness, but also helps to improve our players’ self-confidence, logical analysis ability, language organization ability and on-the-spot response ability.</p>

        <p>  In this whole week,I had lessons on how to do a summary writing excellently in ESL exams. Here are several tips I have learned.</p>
<p>  First,we should pay attention to the instruction information to find out the purpose. Then,highlight the keywords in the text. There are usually over 8 points in all. In addition,organizing them well is important and we do not have to use them in order. Next,the most important tip is not only trying to use our own words with same meanings as much as possible,but also using linking verbs and phrases for example thank to(to explain why something happened),despite this(to contrast ideas),before this (to say when something happened) and so on. Finally,our summary must be within the word limit which is around 100 or 120 words.</p>
<p>  Although this learning process is a little boring,I truly got this skill in the end. Just as the saying goes:”Nothing is difficult to the man who will try”.All in all,come on！</p>

<p>The owner of the tomb was Zhu yuanzhang who was the first emperor and the founder of the Ming Dynasty .In the museum,there was a large mural of the whole view,plenty of works of art .They are all the symbol of history .So I could improve my knowledge by looking around. Inside the park,there were a few deer .I could not stop taking a close look at them. </p>
<p>During this exam,I met lots of excellent contemporaries .Although I have passed it successfully,I learned a lot from them .First,pay attention to every detail ,just like zipping up the coat well when guiding visitors .Second, try to be flexible when meeting problems instead of remaining silence .Third,take to things no matter you do first .This is so-called interest is the best teacher.</p>
<p>The interview was over .I am now looking forward to be the volunteer work next month .Come on!</p>
